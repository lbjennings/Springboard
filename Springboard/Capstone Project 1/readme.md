Capstone Project One:
Predicting grocery store customer reorder habits using InstaCart data.
The main notebooks are ML_grocery_basket and Capstone_EDA. SVD is a mini-project
building a singe decomposition recommender from scrap.  

Documents explanation 

Notebooks:
Capstone_EDA.ipynb : Is the notebook used to wrangle, clean and explore the data. 

ML_grocery_basket.ipynb : Is the notebook building and analyzing the machine learning models. A support vector machine and random forest are the algorithms used to predict the 
Future reorders.

RandomForest.ipynb : Is a lab notebook for trying different ideas in the development stage.

SVD.ipynb : Is a single vector decomposition recommender. It makes recommendations based on customer purchase similarities.
