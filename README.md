# Springboard

This repository highlights data science projects done in conjunction with Springboard. 

The Capstone Projects are portfolio pieces meant to demonstrate the cumulative concepts of the course.
The Mini-Projects highlight the individual concepts taught throughout the course.

Capstone Project 1 is a data science project looking at analyzing grocery customer shopping habits.
It is motivated by recommending engines seen on many online platforms. The idea behind the project is 
to explore the data, identify any interesting trends, and then use the data to make predictions on what
products customers are going to repurchase in their next order.
